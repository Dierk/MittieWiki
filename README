MittieWiki is a single-user personal wiki, in fact a port of my personal (ruby) wiki that I have used for 8 years now.

The new system uses the Grails platform, mainly for the sake of easier extensibility and readability of the code.

This is a spare-time pet project, which has no roadmap and no promised features and milestones whatsoever.
